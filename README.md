This project presents a web-based platform designed to predict the risk of drug
consumption by analyzing individual psychological and demographic profiles.
Focusing on five commonly used substances—Cannabis, Alcohol, Nicotine, Ecstasy,
and Mushrooms—the system employs machine learning models trained on established
correlations between substance use and personality traits, including the Big Five,
impulsivity, and sensation-seeking behaviors. Built with Python and Streamlit for
interactivity, the platform offers a real-time, user-friendly interface supported by a
PostgreSQL database for persistent storage.
The project was executed in two sprints: the first focused on model training, data
preprocessing, and database integration, while the second refined the UI and enhanced
analytics and visualization features. Prediction models including Random Forest,
XGBoost, and Logistic Regression achieved accuracy rates between 75% and 85%.
The final system enables both individuals and healthcare providers to access
personalized risk assessments, visualize underlying trait-risk relationships, and track
predictions over time.
This initiative not only bridges psychological theory with practical application but also
promotes early intervention and informed decision-making in addiction prevention.
Future enhancements include mobile integration, wearable device compatibility, and
privacy-preserving learning techniques.
